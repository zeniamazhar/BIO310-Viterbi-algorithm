# ðŸ§¬ Viterbi Algorithm assignment (Language: Python)

In this bioinformatics assignment, I was tasked to use the Viterbi algorithm, which is a dynamic programming algorithm, to find the sequence of states (in this case: introns, exons, and splice sites) with the highest likelihood of occurring in a given DNA sequence.  The algorithm uses the initial probabilities of the states as well as the transition and emission probabilities in order to do this.
